## Project Description for 3D Scene | R3F
Explore a visually stunning and interactive 3D scene built with React Three Fiber and Next.js, styled with Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates advanced WebGL techniques like environment mapping with HDR textures, realistic materials, and smooth animations including subtle rotation and floating debris.

The heart of the scene is a detailed 3D model loaded from a GLB file, textured with multiple custom maps to create a rich, immersive experience. Users can orbit around the scene using intuitive controls, while the lighting environment adapts dynamically using HDR environment maps.

Built with Reactâ€™s Suspense for efficient lazy loading, this demo highlights how to integrate complex 3D graphics into modern React web apps seamlessly. Explore the live demo or dive into the source code to see React, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS working together for a polished interactive experience.



## Summary:
Interactive 3D scene featuring a detailed GLB model with environment HDR lighting, built using React Three Fiber, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. Includes smooth rotation, floating debris animation, and orbit controls for user exploration.
